# Simple Shell

Welcome to the Simple Shell repository! This project is an implementation of a basic shell that allows users to execute commands and interact with the underlying operating system.

## Features

- Command Execution: Run various system commands just like in a standard shell.
- Basic Built-in Commands: Includes basic built-in commands such as `cd` (change directory) and `exit` (exit the shell).
- Background Processes: Run processes in the background using the `&` symbol.
- Signal Handling: Handle signals like Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP).
